# Auto-generated-time-stamped-folder
Fortran code for auto generating a time-stamped folder, log file, and data file (csv) to store results of each run of the code. The submodules can be easily incorporated in any program. Useful for cases when the same program must be run many times and the corresponding data must be saved in files.
